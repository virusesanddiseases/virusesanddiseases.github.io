The last naturally occurring case was taken in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) propogated the global eradication of the disease in 1980. The risk of death when picking up the disease was around 35%, with higher chances with babies. Often those who survived had permanent scarring of their skin, and some were after surviving, blind.</p>");

Over a period of time the skin rash turned into ooze filled bumps almost like pimples but more actively spread. The bumps then scabbed and eventually just fall off, leaving gruesome scars. The disease was spread between physical contact by people or by contaminated objects.To Prevent this you used the smallpox vaccine. Once the disease had reached it's end, certain  medication might have helped. </p>");
