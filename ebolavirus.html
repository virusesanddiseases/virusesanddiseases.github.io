The viruses symptoms are as follows a fever, muscular pain, sore throat and headaches. Vomiting, diarrhoea and rash are symptoms to that follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally (inside) and externally (outside). The disease has a high risk of death as it is really deadly but rare, killing 30% to 90% of those infected. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to 16 days after symptoms appear.</p>")
