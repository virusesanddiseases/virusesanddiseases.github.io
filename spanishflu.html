Starting from from February 1918 and ending in April 1920, it infected 500 million peopleâ€“about a third of the world's population at the time. The death toll is typically estimated to have been somewhere between 50 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history..</p>");

Scientists offer several possible explanations for the high death toll  of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown the virus to be partly deadly because it starts a cytokine storm, which  contaminates the stronger immune system of young adults .</p>");
