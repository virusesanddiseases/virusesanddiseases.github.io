Swine influenza virus (SIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is found in pigs. As of 2009, the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3. The swine-origin influenza virus that appeared in 2009 and was first found in human beings in Mexico, is was found that at least three parents caught it. Six of the genes are closest in sequence to those of H1N2 'triple-reassortant' influenza viruses isolated from pigs in North America around 1999-2000</p>");
